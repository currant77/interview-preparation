# Lists

## Abstract Data Type

A list supports four basic operations:
* `insert` a value at a given index
* `remove` a value at a given index
* `lookup` the value stores at a given index
* `size` of the list

List implementations also often support operations such as iterating over the values in a list or sorting a list. They are also commonly used as the basis for implementations of other ordered collections such as queues or stacks.

## Implementations

Lists are typically implemented using one of two data structures: as a dynamically-resizing array called at **array list** or as a chain of linked nodes called a **linked list**.
