# Heap

A **heap** is a tree-based data structure that is commonly used to implement the priority queue abstract data type (#REF). It is a *complete* tree (it is totally filled other than the rightmost element in the last level) that satisfies the **heap property**: in a **max heap**, each node's key is greater than or equal to that of its children's; in a **min heap**, the opposite is true. Heaps are most commonly implemented as binary trees - **binary heaps**.

## Properties

A direct consequence of the heap property is that the root node is always the node with the largest or smallest key in a max or min heap, respectively. Furthermore, because the heaps are complete trees, they have height ⌈*log<sub>a</sub>(n)*⌉, where *a* is the tree's branching factor.
